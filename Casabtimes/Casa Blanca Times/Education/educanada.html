            <h2>Requirements for a study visa in Canada: </h2>
            <p>
              Applying for a study permit in Canada requires the submission of a set of basic documents. This includes proof of admission from the educational institution, proof of personal identity, and proof of financial ability. In addition, you may also need to submit a Letter of Explanation (LOE), which is a way to explain your motivation for studying in Canada and your understanding of your obligations as a student. If you intend to study in Quebec for longer than 6 months, you must obtain a Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) from the Gouvernement du Québec, which the educational institution can provide details on how to obtain. You can use the letter of approval from the Ministry of Immigration, de la Francisation et de l'Intégration (MIFI) to apply for a study permit if you are waiting for the acceptance certificate to be issued. Possible additional documents include a medical examination, a declaration of guardianship if the student is a minor, and other documents may also be requested during the visa application process. It is always best to check the Canadian Embassy website to ensure all necessary requirements are met and to obtain the most up-to-date information.
